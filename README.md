# booky-booky
A web app where you can book a number in a queue
Created for a fake bank (Stanbank) but can have multiple applications

Consists of an offline version which makes a recipt with your line number and eventually displays the number being served on the bank moniters
Not yet complete 
written in python 

Then there is a web version, which consists of 2 sides
1) Client-side: where you can view the number being served currently and the next available number so you can estimate how long you have to wait. And you can book a number which will update the next available number
2) Admin-side: where Tellers can serve customers then click a button to get the next costomer along with their inquiries
written in React with a firebase backend. (Soon to be uploaded)

Booky-booky was developed as a project for a in house competition at DSC MSU
Idea from Patrick Zvenyika and Team Booky-booky
Developed by Stan Mpakati
